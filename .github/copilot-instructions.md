This is a personal design portfolio website for Tejashwini S Uranakar, a second-year Information Science student. Use a color palette inspired by a night in the mountains (deep blues, purples, subtle accent colors). The site includes About, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections. Use modern, responsive web design best practices. No frameworks required.
